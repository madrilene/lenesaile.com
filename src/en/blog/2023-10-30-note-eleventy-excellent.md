I have created a few [demo branches for Eleventy Excellent](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/blog/demo-pages/).

Sometimes I get requests via the issues to add tags, or something similar. This makes sense, of course, but after many years of struggling with premium themes of other tools (yes, WordPress...) that wanted to cover every conceivable use case and were thus overly complex and slow, it is very important to me to maintain a clean and simple spirit.

The starter should be able to be developed in all possible directions without having to make too many decisions in advance. That's why I decided to create some further refinements as "demos" that live in their own branch, but move along with the main branch.

So far, I have taken care of issues that have been specifically requested: [gallery](https://eleventy-excellent-gallery.netlify.app/gallery/), [tags](https://eleventy-excellent-tags.netlify.app/tags/) and [pagination](https://eleventy-excellent-pagination.netlify.app/blog/page-1/). More to come!
