lead: "Due to editors being familiar with WordPress, this system was maintained. Design was delivered as a Figma workspace. The English section has been expanded and unnecessary auxiliary plugins have been reduced to a minimum. All necessary functions are provided by the theme itself. There was a lot of technical debt, which is why I built everything from scratch. Existing contents were imported, then sorted into appropriate custom post types (previously all contents were unsorted in 'pages'). A lot of restructuring was done and formerly independent routes were sorted into superior areas. All changed routes were stored as redirects."
