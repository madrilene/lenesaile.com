Accessibility design is about ensuring equal access for people with disabilities. It is about removing barriers to access. I am very committed to this principle and I continually try to improve the user experience for everyone.

## Conformance Status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

www.lenesaile.com aims to be conformant with [WCAG 2.1 Level AA.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
