I respect the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and this policy document explains how I collect and handle any information you provide to me.

## What background data is collected?

This site does not use any third party tracking scripts.
For visitor statistics I use Plausible Analytics, a privacy-first web analytics tool. It is built to comply with the different privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA. Plausible does not use cookies and does not collect any personal data.

## How do I use the data you provide?

This website does not collect any other data.

## How secure is your data?

Very secure, as this website does not collect any information.

## How secure is this website?

This website transmits itself using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider can still see that you are downloading assets from this site, but not its content. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data, for example, while browsing on public WiFi, or from network providers injecting advertisements on this site. All relevant response HTTP headers are set for your protection and the Content Security Policy is adjusted to this websites requirements.

If I change the content of this policy, those changes will be effective at the time I post them here.
