    - summary: "Why do you write in American English?"
      contents: "I have been living in Spain for a long time. There are many words in Spanish that are spelled similarly to American English: ‘color’ / ‘color’ or ‘organize’ / ‘organizar’, for example. Spanish has become like a native language for me, and the American spelling just feels more natural. That said, I'm certainly not consistent with it, and British spelling very likely appears somewhere."
    - summary: "How did you learn web development and design? "
      contents: "I'm still learning, every day. I always read some book about bash scripts, typography, grid layouts, JavaScript, web components; or articles that people from the community so lovingly provide. When I build a new project, I always try to learn something new in the process. Just like that, everything becomes more and more natural, logical, easy, and better, over time."

I have always enjoyed tinkering with computers. In 2004, I started building my first websites with HTML and CSS.

In the beginning, these were simple linked HTML documents that I uploaded directly to the server. As soon as a website grew, this became very cumbersome, because changes in the navigation had to be made individually for each page. Also, there were no CMS (content management systems) for these pages, and only people with HTML knowledge could edit them. I discovered _WordPress_ and learned PHP to broaden the possibilities.

Back then, I was a generalist in all its facets, and in addition to programming, I also did design (and graphic design for print media!), copy, marketing and search engine optimization. I have retained programming and digital design to this day, with a special love for typography, and can advise on the creation and organization of great content.

In 2018 I came across the Jamstack approach (Pre-rendered content + client-side enhancements, served via CDN) and as a consequence revamped all my workflows. Back to static websites, if you will! With _Eleventy_ I found the perfect generator tool, and there was now a whole infrastructure with hosting and CMS solutions available to me.

My focus has always been on personal websites, marketing and business websites or small applications. I want to create meaningful experiences that reflect the personality of people and peculiarities of products, and <sparkly-text class="pl-2xs" number-of-sparkles="5" style="--sparkly-text-color: var(--color-accent)">**bring joy**.</sparkly-text>
