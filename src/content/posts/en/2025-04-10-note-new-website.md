I rebuilt this website! I published the last version of it at the end of 2022. Since then I have learned so many things, gained new insights and so many new CSS possibilities have been added that at some point I was no longer happy with the code here.

Now I have finally found the time, so I took my [Eleventy Starter](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) and rebuilt the website. It still looks the same in many parts, because I quite like the design of the page, but I have refined, improved and changed almost everything.

May I finally find the strength to write articles again! I plan to take a deep dive into OG image creation, and write about how I use Eleventy to create my invoices. Now that I've said it, I have to stick to it! 📝
